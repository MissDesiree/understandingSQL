Introduction to SQL: Understanding Databases and Data Retrieval
What is SQL?
SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a special programming language used to interact with databases (Coronel & Morris, 2019). It allows users to store, retrieve, update, and delete data from a database. Some people pronounce it as "SQL" (sequel), while others say each letter separately as "S-Q-L." Both pronunciations are correct and used interchangeably in the industry.
What is a Database?
Before understanding SQL, we first need to understand databases. A database is a central location where large amounts of data are stored and managed (Elmasri & Navathe, 2020). For example, companies like Yahoo Finance store financial data such as stock prices, historical trends, and company performance in databases. These databases update regularly to provide real-time information to users.
For instance, when you look up the Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock price on Yahoo Finance, you see a variety of details such as:
Current stock value
Daily price changes
Percentage increase or decrease
Stock’s highest and lowest value in the past year
All of this information is stored in a data warehouse—a large-scale database that collects and organizes data (Inmon, 2022). Without a properly managed database, this information could not be displayed accurately or updated frequently.
Why Do We Need SQL?
SQL is essential because it is the main way to communicate with a database (Oppel, 2021). Once data is stored in a database, users need a way to retrieve, modify, or delete the data when necessary. SQL allows users to:
Retrieve Data – Example: Get stock information for Apple from a year ago.
Update Data – Example: Fix missing or incorrect financial records.
Delete Data – Example: Remove outdated stock prices from the database.
Create New Data – Example: Add new company listings to a stock market database.
By using SQL, businesses can analyze and make sense of their data to make informed decisions.
How SQL Works with Databases
Databases store millions of rows of data. SQL helps users interact with this data by writing queries—special instructions that tell the database what to do. For example, if a company wants to know how many products were sold in the past month, they would write an SQL query to retrieve that information.
In simple terms, the process looks like this:
Data is stored in a database.
SQL is used to retrieve or modify that data.
The retrieved data helps answer business questions.
Without SQL, businesses would struggle to manage large amounts of data efficiently.
Conclusion
SQL is a powerful tool that allows users to interact with databases easily. It helps businesses store, retrieve, and analyze data efficiently. Understanding SQL is essential for anyone working with data, whether in finance, healthcare, e-commerce, or any other industry. By learning SQL, users can improve decision-making and problem-solving through better data management.
